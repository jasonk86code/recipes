Serves 6

Ingredients:
-1 1/2 lbs flank steak
-1/4 cup cornstarch
-1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
-2 Tbs ricen wine vinegar
-2 Tbs brown sugar
-2 Tbs sweet chili sauce
-6 green onions
-2 Tbs sesame oil
-1 Tbs minced garlic
-1 teaspoon ginger
-1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
-2 Cups broccoli florets


Directions:
1. To prepare the flank steak, slice the meat on an angle in thin strips against the grain.
2. In a large resealable bag, combine the steak slices and cornstarch and shake until evenly coated; set aside.
3. In a mediaum sauce pan, whisk together the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, and chili sauce until evenly combined. Heat the sauce pan over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 5-7 minutes; set aside.
4. In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, red chili flakes, and green onions. Cook stirring constantly for about 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Shake off the excess cornstarch from the reserved steak, and add it all to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes, browning all sides. Add the set-aside sauce and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. If using frozen broccoli, cook according to package directions. If using fresh broccoli, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Boil the broccoli for 1-2 minutes, or until tender, then drain.
